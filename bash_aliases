# ~/.bash_aliases
# 
# Alias definitions
# =================
# I keep my additions here, for easier access and modularity. This file is
# sourced by ~/.bashrc at shell spawn, effectively inserting it inline. 

#     You may want to put all your additions into a separate file like
#     ~/.bash_aliases, instead of adding them here directly.
#     See /usr/share/doc/bash-doc/examples in the bash-doc package.
